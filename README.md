# **Introduction**
The heart is a fist-sized organ that pumps blood throughout the human body. It’s the primary organ of the human circulatory system. It pumps blood in the human body for 70 beats per minute, and it does so using arteries. When these arteries are blocked, it poses a serious problem. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of heart disease where the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is the leading cause of death in the United States. About 18.2 million American adults have coronary artery disease, making it the most common type of heart disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

## **Problem statement**
This project focuses on determining the factors that cause a patient to develop coronary heart disease and predict the odds of patients developing coronary heart disease in ten years using the logistic regression model. 

## The predictor variables for this model are
  1.  Gender
  2.  Age
  3.  Prevalent stroke
  4.  Prevalent hypertension
  5.  Diabetes
  6.  Current smoker

## **Insights from the Analysis**
  1.  If a person is old (above 65 years), the chances of developing coronary heart disease in ten years are 30% more than a young one.
  2.  If a person is male, he’s almost 20% more likely to develop coronary heart disease than a female in ten years.
  3.  A diabetic person is also 20% more likely to develop coronary heart disease than a non-diabetic in ten years.
  4.  A hypertensive smoker is almost 10% more likely to develop coronary heart disease than a non-hypertensive smoker in ten years.
  5.  Surprisingly, a hypertensive smoker has almost the same likelihood of developing coronary heart disease as a hypertensive non-smoker.

## **Conclusion**
The World Health Organization estimates that 12 million people die each year as a result of heart disease. Cardiovascular diseases account for half of all fatalities in the United States and other developed countries. The early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease can help high-risk individuals make lifestyle adjustments, which can lessen consequences. This research revealed that age, prevalent hypertension, gender, smoking, and diabetes all have a significant impact on assessing the chance of having coronary heart disease in the next ten years. Smoking because both nicotine and carbon monoxide (from the smoke) put a strain on the heart by making it work faster, increasing the risk of blood clots which could lead to coronary heart disease. Hypertension because it puts a strain on the heart, increasing the odds of developing CHD. Diabetes because over time, high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart leading to coronary heart disease. Lastly, aging is associated with a progressive decline in numerous physiological processes, leading to an increased risk of health complications and disease. By delivering oxygenated blood to all tissues in the body, the health of the cardiovascular system is vital for the health of every tissue and the longevity of the organism as a whole. Aging has a remarkable effect on the heart and arterial system, leading to an increase in coronary disease.

## **Recommendations**
To reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, one must prioritize one's health. Eat a good and balanced diet to keep your blood sugar in check and avoid diabetes; exercise to maintain a healthy weight and reduce your chances of getting hypertensive; and stop smoking and drinking alcohol. If you are already hypertensive or diabetic, take your medications seriously.
