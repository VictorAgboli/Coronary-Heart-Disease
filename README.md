# **Introduction**
The heart is a fist-sized organ that pumps blood throughout the human body. It’s the primary organ of the human circulatory system. It pumps blood in the human body for 70 beats per minute, and it does so using arteries. When these arteries are blocked, it poses a serious problem. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of heart disease where the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is the leading cause of death in the United States. About 18.2 million American adults have coronary artery disease, making it the most common type of heart disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

## **Problem statement**
This project focuses on determining the factors that cause a patient to develop coronary heart disease and predict the odds of patients developing coronary heart disease in ten years using the logistic regression model. 

## The predictor variables for this model are
  1.  Gender
  2.  Age
  3.  Prevalent stroke
  4.  Prevalent hypertension
  5.  Diabetes
  6.  Current smoker
