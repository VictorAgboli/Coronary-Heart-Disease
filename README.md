# **Introduction**
The heart is a fist-sized organ that pumps blood throughout the human body. Itâ€™s the primary organ of the human circulatory system. It pumps blood in the human body for 70 beats per minute, and it does so using arteries. When these arteries are blocked, it poses a serious problem. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of heart disease where the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is the leading cause of death in the United States. About 18.2 million American adults have coronary artery disease, making it the most common type of heart disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

## **Problem statement**
This project focuses on determining the factors that cause a patient to develop coronary heart disease and predict the odds of patients developing coronary heart disease in ten years using the logistic regression model. 

## The predictor variables for this model are
  1.  Gender
  2.  Age
  3.  Prevalent stroke
  4.  Prevalent hypertension
  5.  Diabetes
  6.  Current smoker

## **Insights from the Analysis**
  1.  A person over the age of 65 has a 30% higher likelihood of developing coronary heart disease in ten years than a young person.
  2.  In ten years, a man is nearly 20% more likely than a woman to have coronary heart disease.
  3.  In ten years, a diabetic individual is 20% more likely than a non-diabetic to have coronary heart disease.
  4.  A hypertensive smoker is almost 10% more likely to develop coronary heart disease than a non-hypertensive smoker in ten years.
  5.  Surprisingly, a hypertensive smoker has about the same risk of coronary heart disease as a hypertensive nonsmoker.

## **Conclusion**
The World Health Organization estimates that heart disease kills 12 million people per year. In the United States and other developed countries, cardiovascular diseases account for half of all mortality. Early detection of cardiovascular disease can assist high-risk patients in making lifestyle changes that can reduce the effects. 

This research revealed that age, prevalent hypertension, gender, smoking, and diabetes all have a significant impact on assessing the chance of having coronary heart disease in the next ten years. Smoking because both nicotine and carbon monoxide (from the smoke) put a strain on the heart by making it work faster, increasing the risk of blood clots which could lead to coronary heart disease. Hypertension because it puts a strain on the heart, increasing the odds of developing CHD. Diabetes because over time, high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart leading to coronary heart disease. 

Lastly, aging is connected with a steady deterioration in several physiological systems, leading to an increased risk of health issues and illness. The circulatory system's health is critical for the health of all tissues and the longevity of the organism as a whole since it delivers oxygenated blood to all tissues in the body. Aging has a profound influence on the heart and vascular system, resulting in a rise in coronary disease.

## **Recommendations**
Prioritizing one's health is crucial for lowering the risk of coronary heart disease. Eat a well-balanced diet to keep your blood sugar under control and avoid diabetes; exercise to maintain a healthy weight and lower your risks of becoming hypertensive; and quit smoking and drinking alcohol. Take your medications seriously if you are already hypertensive or diabetic.
